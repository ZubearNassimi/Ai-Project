Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset regressor model


Abstract

Parkinson's Telemonitoring is a dataset derived from a study aimed at predicting Parkinson's Disease symptoms using various speech signal features. The study involved 5875 observations collected via telemonitoring devices developed in collaboration with medical centers and Intel Corporation. The dataset contains multivariate data representing clinical and acoustic measurements, which are utilized to predict motor and total UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) scores.

In this project, a Random Forest Regressor was trained to predict the total_UPDRS score using a subset of the dataset's features. After cleaning the dataset by removing redundant columns (subject# and motor_UPDRS) and performing exploratory data analysis, the model was evaluated using an 80-20 train-test split. The final results indicated that the Random Forest model achieved strong predictive performance, demonstrating its effectiveness for regression tasks on medical datasets. The insights generated could aid clinicians in tracking disease progression and customizing treatment plans.
